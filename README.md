### About the Project
<p align="justify">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's world road and transport has become an integral part of every human being. Everybody is a road user in one shape or the other. The present transport system 
  has minimized the distances but it has on the other hand increased the life risk. Every year road crashes result in loss of lakhs of lives and serious injuries to crores of people.<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In India itself about eighty thousand people are killed in road crashes every year which is thirteen percent of the total fatality all over the world. Man behind 
  the wheel plays an important role in most of the crashes. In most of the cases crashes occurs either due to carelessness or due to lack of road safety awareness of the road user. Hence, road 
  safety education is as essential as any other basic skills of survival.
